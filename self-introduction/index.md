Hello, my name is Andrey. My specialty is marketing, but for the last fifteen years, I have worked as a transport engineer in a large construction company.

Up to a certain point, I was sure that my work suited me well, and there was no desire to change anything in my professional life, until last April when I was offered to take free online courses for a full-stack web application developer.

During this basic course, that lasted for two months, I managed to get acquainted with the basic tools and technologies of web development such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also, while studying, I came to work with PHP and MySQL, and finally I wrote a certification project based on the acquired knowledge.

Of course, most of the effort was spent on the UI component of my first project, and code could have been a lot cleaner, still the most important thing I learned is that - programming is really fun and I want to continue doing it.

After finishing my first class, the stage zero of Rolling Scope School started, for which I successfully signed up. And now, having completed this course, I can appreciate how well it was designed - such a perfect balance between the amount of material studied and the time to complete practical tasks.

There were many practical problems, all of them were completely new to me and very interesting. I happily spent all my free time on school projects.

The next stage of training (The Stage one) brought strict deadlines and an avalanche of new information. As it turns out, programming is not just about knowing certain languages. All of a sudden the following tools and technologies burst into my life:
Git, Linters, Bundlers, modules, Node-JS, OOP, and finally, as the icing on the cake, came Algorithms and Data Structures.

It was a lot of new information, and all at the same time. And there is no way to be able to figure each of those new topics in every detail due to deadlines.

The first stage of schooling is about to end. Am I disappointed? Not at all, on the contrary, I am excited and impatiently waiting. I can't help but feel like I'm finally doing something I really like.
Thanks everyone for watching. Good luck in your studies. See you!
